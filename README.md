# plug-debug

A Clojure and Clojurescript library with small debug helpers

# DEPRECATION NOTICE

This code has been moved to plug-utils.debug.

# DISCLAIMER

This library should be considered experimental. An experiment in code reuse and boilerplate reduction.

Use at your own risk! Breakage is to be expected as:

- Library is gradually tuned for my typical use cases.
- I improve on my general library development
